## Cameron Logie

Before joining Makers, I studied psychology at King's College London and graduated with a 2-1. I joined a recruitment company straight out of university to work on my sales and people skills. I planned on working there for at least a year, until COVID-19 took the world by storm. I was placed on furlough in April 2020, and I took on software engineering as a hobby and potential next direction. After a few months of playing around in Ruby on Codecademy and Codewars, I realized that I really enjoyed learning how to code and decided to make the plunge into a bootcamp. 

I have truly enjoyed this process of becoming a software developer. It is a unique  position that allows me to learn a vast array of different systems and tools, become a better problem solver, become a better researcher, create programs that interest me, and share my passion for technology with other like-minded individuals. I am looking forward to developing more skills and competencies as I progress through this journey. 

<!-- I was born and raised in San Jose, CA in the heart of the Silicon Valley. Growing up I lived the technology boom, where there was immense pace in how quickly new technologies were introduced and rolled out. I was so fascinated by these technologies, be it games, turning on lights with my phone, or even just being able to send a photograph over bluetooth. I can only relate it to how I felt looking up at the stars in the night sky, a feeling of vast possibility. I used to put Apple's yearly iPhone and iOS release on my calendar just so I could be the first to see the new features I would be able to use (if I had had an iPhone). I saw tech giants like Apple, Google, and Facebook (amongst others) rise to extreme prominence, tech was the cream-of-the-crop.
These companies, amongst many others, made such a profound impact on my upbringing at a multitude of levels. I want to be in tech so that I can make an impact on bringing the inspiration and fascination that I had, to others around the world. -->

## Skills

#### Test-Driven Development

Part of my development process is using a test-driven development approach. TDD was emphasized heavily as a useful process during the Makers course, as it helps to keep the project building focused and organized. I follow a red-green-refactor method, first writing a failing test, then writing the simplest code to make the test pass and finally refactoring to implement business logic. This keeps my work organized and saves me time throughout the length of a project.

- MakersBnB and the Acebook backend API were test driven.
- In addition, various earlier projects like the airport challenge, the takeaway challenge, the rps-challenge, and the bookmark manager, in addition to others were all created using a strict TDD process. 
- When spiking (not using TDD), the code became much less structured and debugging was much harder

#### Diagramming

Before each of my projects, I find creating a plan and diagramming the structure of the app to be a very useful part of my development process. Diagramming helps to  create different project designs before beginning so that when the project is being built, the design is thought through and optimized. In addition, when in doubt whilst actually building the project, it can be referenced when at a blocked. 

- I use class diagrams to think out the relationships between objects in a program
- I often use the Model-View-Controller-Database diagram to think through the request and response cycle of my program
- In each of the MakersBnB, Acebook, and London Mock Exchange projects, we began by creating class and MVC diagrams to agree on a project design

## Education
