## Cameron Logie

I am a budding full-stack web developer currently learning at Makers Academy, and due to graduate in December 2020.

Before joining Makers, I studied psychology at King's College London and graduated with a 2-1. I joined a recruitment company straight out of university to work on my sales and people skills. I planned on working there for at least a year, until COVID-19 took the world by storm. I was placed on furlough in April 2020, started to work on my software engineering skills and never went back.

I have truly enjoyed this process of becoming a software developer. It is a unique  position that allows me to learn a vast array of different systems and tools, become a better problem solver, become a better researcher, create programs that interest me, and share my passion for technology with other like-minded individuals. I am looking forward to developing more skills and competencies as I progress through this journey. 

<!-- I was born and raised in San Jose, CA in the heart of the Silicon Valley. Growing up I lived the technology boom, where there was immense pace in how quickly new technologies were introduced and rolled out. I was so fascinated by these technologies, be it games, turning on lights with my phone, or even just being able to send a photograph over bluetooth. I can only relate it to how I felt looking up at the stars in the night sky, a feeling of vast possibility. I used to put Apple's yearly iPhone and iOS release on my calendar just so I could be the first to see the new features I would be able to use (if I had had an iPhone). I saw tech giants like Apple, Google, and Facebook (amongst others) rise to extreme prominence, tech was the cream-of-the-crop.

These companies, amongst many others, made such a profound impact on my upbringing at a multitude of levels. I want to be in tech so that I can make an impact on bringing the inspiration and fascination that I had, to others around the world. -->
